> The iridescent magical nature of the Cormorant’s black feathers reflects this land bird’s ability to enter another dimension; to be part of it yet separate. The Dreaming cause of the black feathers, fire, brings this element into the air (flight), land and water aspects of this bird. In fact, Cormorant is a symbol of exploring the four levels or realms of existence, possessing the quality of adaptability.  If you encounter a Cormorant, let the opportunity remind you of your Cormorant qualities and the need for their expression. It is time to take the plunge, or dry out on land, or go for a flight – or play with fire?
